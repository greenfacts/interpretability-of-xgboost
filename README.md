# Biomedical Text Document Classification Using Gradient Boosting, with Model Interpretability
The objectives for this work are as follows:  
- Exploration of gradient boosting models
- Exploration of model interpretability using SHAP values
- Comparision of TF-IDF and SHAP interpretability

## Dataset description:  
For Biomedical text document classification, abstract and full papers(whose length less than or equal to 6 pages) available and used. This dataset focused on long research paper whose page size more than 6 pages. Dataset includes cancer documents to be classified into 3 categories like 'Thyroid_Cancer','Colon_Cancer','Lung_Cancer'.  
Total publications=7569. it has 3 class labels in dataset.  
Number of samples in each categories:  
colon cancer=2579, lung cancer=2180, thyroid cancer=2810
